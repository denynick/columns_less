      <p>
        The black-and-white striped badger is a well-known species in the UK.
        It is our largest land predator feeding on small mammals, birds' eggs, worms,
        fruit and plants. Badgers live in large family groups in burrows under the ground
        called a "sett". You know if a sett is lived in as it is usually neat and tidy with
        clean doorways marked with piles of used bedding made up of dry grass and leaves.

      <p>
        Beavers are Britain's largest rodent, the group of mammals that includes rats,
        mice, and voles. They live in freshwater habitats, like rivers and streams,
        and prefer areas surrounded by wetland plants, trees and woodland. They are
        rather slow on land but excellent swimmers, so they feel safest when they're
        close to deep water (around 70cm deep). If the water isn't deep enough for them,
        beavers can make it deeper.

      <p>
        Hedgehogs eat all kinds of invertebrates, as well as amphibians, birds'
        eggs and anything else they can catch; they particularly like big, crunchy
        beetles and earthworms, making them a gardener's best friend. Hedgehogs hibernate
        over winter, from about November to April, in a nest of leaves or logs called
        a 'hibernaculum'.
